            "This update brings a complete overhaul of the core game systems including networking, physics, rendering, and AI. We have rewritten the entire networking stack to support better latency and more concurrent players. The physics engine now handles complex interactions between objects more realistically. Our rendering pipeline has been optimized for lower-end hardware while maintaining visual fidelity on high-end systems.",
